# Reinforcement Learninig: Zero to Hero
this repository was planned to, to have theiry of every topic, but i dont get enough time to document everything. now only necessary and popular algorithms will be covered.
This reinforcement learning series is inspired by the Google DeepMind XUCL Reinforcement Learning YouTube series.  
Everything in this repository is structured according to the content taught by Research Scientist **Hado van Hasselt**, **Diana Borsa**, and Research Engineer **Matteo Hessel**.

## About This Repository

This repository is built for: 

- Heavy Theory (even at research level)
- Core deep dive into algorithms
- Algorithm implementations
- Experiments
- Reference code

This repository is **NOT** meant to be a theory book.

All theory, learning roadmap, deep explanation, intuition, and structured lectures will be published on **Substack**.

---

## Important Note for Visitors

If you are following this repository, **do not start learning only from code**.

The actual learning path will live on Substack. (with code explanations on Substack) 
This GitHub repository exists only to support learning through implementations.

Once Substack posts are available:

- You should read theory on Substack first  (with code explainations there: to make it easy theory with code-- explained in simple english)
- Then return to GitHub for code and experiments  (full code setup of algorithms and model's etc)

**Learning happens on Substack.**  
**Full Scale Implementation happens on GitHub.**

## How to Read This Repo

Each topic in this repo contains two folders:

- `theory`
- `algorithms`

### Folder usage:

- The **theory** folder will contain links to Substack articles (when published).
- The **algorithms** folder contains Python implementations.

Substack is used because it allows:
- Visual explanations
- Code walkthroughs
- Mathematical clarity
- Better structured learning than GitHub Markdown

GitHub is used for:
- Code
- Experiments
- Reproducible implementations

---

## Status

This repository is currently **in progress**.

Content, structure, and implementations will be added continuously.

---

## Vision

This project is designed as:

> Learn from Substack (deep dive at research level: with code explained in simple english, with visuals).  
> Practice on GitHub.

If you are serious about mastering Reinforcement Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning, follow both together.
