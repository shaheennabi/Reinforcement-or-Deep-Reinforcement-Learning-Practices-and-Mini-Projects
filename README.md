# Reinforcement-or-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Practices-and-Mini-Projects

This reinforcement learning series is inspired by the Google DeepMind XUCL Reinforcement Learning YouTube series.  
Everything in this repository is structured according to the content taught by Research Scientist **Hado van Hasselt**, **Diana Borsa**, and Research Engineer **Matteo Hessel**.

## About This Repository

This repository is built for:

- Practice
- Mini-projects
- Algorithm implementations
- Experiments
- Reference code

This repository is **NOT** meant to be a theory book.

All theory, learning roadmap, deep explanation, intuition, and structured lectures will be published on **Substack**.

---

## Important Note for Visitors

If you are following this repository, **do not start learning only from code**.

The actual learning path will live on Substack.  
This GitHub repository exists only to support learning through implementations.

Once Substack posts are available:

- You should read theory on Substack first  
- Then return to GitHub for code and experiments  

**Learning happens on Substack.**  
**Implementation happens on GitHub.**

## How to Read This Repo

Each topic in this repo contains two folders:

- `theory`
- `algorithms`

### Folder usage:

- The **theory** folder will contain links to Substack articles (when published).
- The **algorithms** folder contains Python implementations and mini-projects.

Substack is used because it allows:
- Visual explanations
- Code walkthroughs
- Mathematical clarity
- Better structured learning than GitHub Markdown

GitHub is used for:
- Code
- Experiments
- Reproducible implementations

---

## Status

This repository is currently **in progress**.

Content, structure, and implementations will be added continuously.

---

## Vision

This project is designed as:

> Learn from Substack.  
> Practice on GitHub.

If you are serious about mastering Reinforcement Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning, follow both together.
